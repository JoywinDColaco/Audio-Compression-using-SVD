   - Supports reading from and writing to files, particularly for array data in text or binary formats (`np.loadtxt`, `np.savetxt`, `np.save`, etc.).

### Example Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Element-wise operations
arr = arr * 2  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Reshaping an array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
reshaped_arr = arr_2d.reshape((4, 1))  # Reshapes to 4x1 array

# Array math
mean = np.mean(arr)  # Compute mean
std = np.std(arr)    # Compute standard deviation
```

### Common Use Cases:
- **Data manipulation**: Efficient handling of large datasets for scientific research and analysis.

### Key Features:

1. **Simple Progress Bar for Loops**:
   - The most common use of `tqdm` is to display a progress bar for iterations over loops. You simply wrap your iterable with `tqdm`, and it will display a dynamic progress bar that updates as the loop executes.

   ```python
   from tqdm import tqdm
   import time

   for i in tqdm(range(100)):
       time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulate a time-consuming task
   ```

2. **Support for Iterables and Generators**:
   - You can wrap any iterable or generator with `tqdm` to track its progress. This includes not only lists and ranges but also files, streams, and other objects.

   ```python
   with open("large_file.txt", "r") as file:
       for line in tqdm(file, total=1000):
           # Process each line
           pass
   ```

3. **Progress Bar Customization**:
   - You can customize the progress bar's appearance and behavior. This includes modifying the progress bar width, color, format, description, and even specifying the total number of iterations (if not automatically detected).

   ```python
   for i in tqdm(range(100), desc="Processing", unit=" iterations", ncols=80):
       time.sleep(0.05)  # Simulate work
   ```

4. **Notebook Integration**:
   - `tqdm` works seamlessly in Jupyter notebooks with the `tqdm.notebook` module. This allows you to display visually appealing progress bars specifically designed for the notebook interface.

   ```python
   from tqdm.notebook import tqdm

   for i in tqdm(range(100)):
       time.sleep(0.1)
   ```

   for i in tqdm(range(3), desc="Outer Loop"):
       for j in tqdm(range(5), desc="Inner Loop"):
           time.sleep(0.1)
   ```

6. **Manual Control**:
   - In some situations, you may need to manually update the progress bar. `tqdm` allows you to explicitly control the progress bar updates using the `update()` method.
   
   ```python
   with tqdm(total=100) as pbar:
       for i in range(10):
           time.sleep(0.1)
           pbar.update(10)  # Increment the progress by 10
   ```

7. **Error Handling and Redirection**:
   - If a process encounters an error or exception, `tqdm` will still properly close the progress bar. It also supports redirecting output (like print statements) to prevent them from interfering with the progress bar's display.

8. **Support for Parallel Processing**:
   - `tqdm` works well with parallel processing libraries like `concurrent.futures` or `multiprocessing`. It can be used to track the progress of parallel tasks across multiple threads or processes.

   ```python
   from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
   from tqdm import tqdm

       time.sleep(0.1)
       return n

   with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
       list(tqdm(executor.map(task, range(100)), total=100))
   ```

9. **Integration with Pandas**:
   - You can integrate `tqdm` with the Pandas library for tracking progress during DataFrame operations like `apply()`, `map()`, and `groupby()`.
   
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from tqdm import tqdm
   tqdm.pandas()  # Add progress bar support to Pandas

   df = pd.DataFrame({'a': range(1000)})
   df.progress_apply(lambda x: x['a'] ** 2, axis=1)
   ```

10. **Rich Information Display**:
    - The progress bar shows more than just progress. It can display the elapsed time, estimated remaining time, iterations per second (speed), and more detailed information about the task's execution.

    ```python
    for i in tqdm(range(100), ascii=True, ncols=100, desc="Processing"):
        time.sleep(0.05)
    ```

### Example Code:
Here’s a simple example of using `tqdm` to track the progress of a loop:

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

# Simulate a task with 100 iterations
for i in tqdm(range(100), desc="Progress", unit=" steps", ascii=True):
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

### Use Cases:
- **Long-running loops**: Monitor the progress of loops that take time to execute, such as file processing, web scraping, or computation-heavy tasks.
